As it currently stands, cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the second leading cause of death for Canadians (Statistics Canada, 2022). Over years of study, scientists have been able to identify and track certain risk factors for CVD in order to better inform prevention and mitigation efforts. Sex-based differences in both the prevalence and clinical presentation of CVDs have long been a topic of interest with men being afflicted by the disease both more frequently and earlier in their lives (P.H.A of Canada, 2017). The male-focused lens in studying CVDs has historically meant considerable rates of underdiagnosis for women and a misunderstanding of the differences in presentation of disease. 
 
In this project, our aim is to use compiled data to quantify the difference in mean age between men and women suffering from CVD and their respective standard deviations. To achieve this we will be using the “Heart Disease Data Set” published on the UCI Machine Learning Repository by David Aha. We have selected the Cleveland Clinic database as opposed to the European databases to obtain results that can be generalized to the greater Canadian public based on similar lifestyle and socio-economic distributions between the United States and Canada (Solé-Auro et al., 2017). We utilize the bootstrap method, hypothesis testing, and confidence intervals along with visualizations for a well-informed analysis using inferential tools as a guide.
